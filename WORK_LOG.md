| April 5     |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| February 24 |  2:30 - 3:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                                        Throughout this time I was working with Caden on how to approach this problem. We ended up with an algorithm where you have two recursive steps where you include the first letter and exclude the first letter. This is a very similar approach to the coin quiz problem. |
| February 24 | 11:40 - 12:00 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Worked on the recursive function to approach this problem. I just added the recursive steps that include or exlucde the first letter in the first string. Addtionally, I added if statements to check which case is bigger and return the biggest one. |
| February 25 |  8:40 - 9:10  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Added my base cases and my if statements in my recursive algorithm. My base case is if doc 1's length is 1 and it is in doc 2, return counter + 1. Otherwise just return counter. My if statements just find which case is bigger and returns the biggest one. |
| February 26 | 12:50 - 1:45  |                                                                                                                                                                                     I just made some changes to the code because only 1 away from the correct answer in the first test case. I realized that I actually forgot the remove the characters so it kept on counting the length of string. As a result, I passed the first test case but the rest are still incorrect. |
| February 27 | 10:00 - 10:20 |                                                                                        Here I was debugging again to see why my algorithm is really off for the other test cases. I realized that I had my exclude in a else case, meaning that if the include can happen, it is never going to exclude. It is going to be 1 or the other. Therefore, I got rid of this but it still wasn't working. I tried adding other recursive steps but I was getting everything wrong now. |
| February 27 |  8:50 - 9:40  | I worked on reverting my code to what it used to be (where it passes the 1st test case). I ran the other test cases and now I have the problem where they are really so. Therefore, I decided to start implementing memoization. I created a table, passed it to the recursive function, and saved the biggest case on the the table. I eventually got all of the test cases to go through. However, I'm still way off and I started looking as to why but could'nt figure it out. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
